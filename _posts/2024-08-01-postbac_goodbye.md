It's always bittersweet to say goodbye to our post-bacs as they head off to graduate school.

<a href="/members/spurney">Megan</a> is off to a Clinical Psych PhD with Dr. Katie Insel, at Northwestern University, 
<a href="/members/gephart">Isabel</a> is heading to the University of Chicago to work with Dr. Monica Rosenberg in the Department of Psychology, and <a href="/members/gobo">Tori</a> is heading to Baylor College of Medicince for a Neuroscience PhD.

We're very sad to see them go, but incredibly excited to see all the amazing things that they're going to accomplish.
