<p>It's that time of year when we're sad to say goodbye to our post-bacs as they head off to their next steps. We had the chance to celebrate <a href="/members/dean">Josh</a> over lunch as he heads off to University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. We'll miss him terribly, but we're excited to see all the he accomplishes in medical school!</p>
