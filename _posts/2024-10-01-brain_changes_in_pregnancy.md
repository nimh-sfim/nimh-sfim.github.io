A new paper in <i>Nature Neuroscience</i> with SFIM co-authors <a href='/members/faskowitz'>Josh Faskowitz</a> and <a href="/members/handwerker">Dan Handwerker</a> was recently published. This project, lead by Drs. Laura Pritschet and Emily Jacobs at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Elizabeth Chrastil at the University of California, Irvine, tracked changes in brain structure and function, in addition to hormonal levels in a first-time mother from three weeks prior to conception to two years after giving birth to investigate how pregnancy impacts the brain.
