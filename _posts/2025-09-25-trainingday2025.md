<p>Each year, fellows at NIMH have the opportunity to share their work at the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/scientific-director/office-of-fellowship-and-training/nimh-irp-fellows-annual-scientific-training-day">NIMH IRP Fellow's Training Day</a>. Post-bacs and post-docs present posters and oral presentations to the NIMH community, giving them the opportunity to foster potential collaboration and build community within NIMH.
