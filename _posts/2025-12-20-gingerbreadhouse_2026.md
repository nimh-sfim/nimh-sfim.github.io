<p>Every winter, the NIH Clinical Center puts on a gingerbread house competition. This competition began in 2004 by the Clinical Center Nursing Department to promote teamwork and holiday spirit between nursing units. Today, the competition has expanded to all Clinical Center staff. All entries recieve the same gingerbread house kit, but are encouraged to get creative, and votes are collected electronically for the best gingerbread house.</p>

<p>This year, SFIM entered with the MAGNET-ficent Ginger-BRAIN house. Led by post-doc Sharif Kronemer, the members of SFIM worked together to create a sugary 7T MRI. Although our candy scanner and completely anatomically accurate brain did not win a prize, much fun was had!</p>
