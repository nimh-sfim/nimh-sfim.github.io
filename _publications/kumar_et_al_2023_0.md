abstract: 'Substantial changes in behavior, physiology, and brain function occur when alertness decreases 1-5. These changes in brain function involve increased synchronization between cortical areas 6,7 as well as alterations in sensory processing pathways and networks connecting the thalamus and cortex 5,8-11. Cognitive tasks engage overlapping functional networks with sensory pathways facilitating information processing 12,13, and thalamocortical and corticocortical networks supporting task performance 14,15. Frontoparietal circuits play a crucial role in cognitive tasks 16 and states of decreased consciousness 17. To develop an integrated framework of consciousness and cognition, it is important to understand how fluctuations in alertness and cognitive processing interact in these shared circuits 18. Our hypothesis is that during periods of low alertness, individuals who actively maintain task engagement would recruit additional frontoparietal and sensory processing networks, while thalamocortical dynamics that typically change during sleep onset would remain unaffected. Our findings demonstrated that as alertness decreased, passively listening to auditory tones led to increased synchronization in the parietal lobe, whereas actively performing an auditory task resulted in increased long-range frontoparietal synchronization. During decreasing alertness, passive listening (but not active task engagement) was associated with widespread increased synchronization between the thalamus and cortex. In contrast, active task engagement (but not passive listening) led to increased synchronization between the auditory cortex and the rest of the brain. These results reveal the functional mechanisms of the brain&amp;apos;s flexible reorganization during transitions of consciousness when individuals are actively engaged in cognitive processes.'
