abstract: "High spatio-temporal resolution is crucial for neuroimaging techniques to improve our understanding of human brain function. While the fMRI signal is slow and shows a spread in latencies over space, the precision of hemodynamic response latency for each voxel is preserved and has been shown to be able to detect oscillatory hemodynamic changes approaching 1 Hz, suggesting its potential to reveal rapid neural dynamics. To examine how fast neural information can be derived from fMRI signals, we performed experiments that acquire high-field (7T) fMRI signals at an ultra-fast sampling rate (TR = 125 ms) from the visual cortex while participants observed naturalistic object stimuli. We applied multivariate pattern decoders to extract presented object-category information from the acquired signals at each sampling time after stimulus onset. Results showed that decoding accuracy rose above statistical significance less than 2 s after signal onset, faster than the peak latency of the hemodynamic response. The peak latency of the decoding accuracy was independent of variations in the hemodynamic latency of voxels used for decoding. The application of sparse decoders further revealed that rapid and accurate decoding was possible by pruning vein-rich voxels off from the multivariate voxel input to the decoders. These results suggest that a combination of ultra-fast sampling and multivariate decoding allows fast and temporally precise analysis of neural activity using fMRI signals."
