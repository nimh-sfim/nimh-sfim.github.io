abstract: 'Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a growing and promising field, as it has great potential to further our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain function in health and disease. In particular, there is much interest in understanding the fMRI correlates of brain activity in the gamma band (> 30 Hz), as these frequencies are thought to be associated with cognitive processes involving perception, attention, and memory, as well as with disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. However, progress in this area has been limited due to issues such as MR-induced artifacts in EEG recordings, which seem to be more problematic for gamma frequencies. This paper presents a noise removal method for the gamma band of EEG that is based on the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA), but with a new implementation strategy. HHSA uses a nested empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to identify amplitude and frequency modulations (AM and FM, respectively) by averaging over frequencies with high and significant powers. Our method examines gamma band by applying two layers of EMD to the FM and AM components, removing components with very low power based on the power-instantaneous frequency spectrum, and subsequently reconstructs the denoised gamma-band signal from the remaining components. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed method efficiently reduces artifacts while preserving the original gamma signal which is especially critical for simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies.'
