abstract: 'CMRO2 represents a key indicator of the physiological state of brain tissue. Dynamic 17O-MRI with inhalation of isotopically enriched 17O gas has been used to quantify global CMRO2 in brain white (WM) and gray matter (GM). However, global CMRO2 can only reflect the overall oxygen metabolism of the brain and cannot provide enough information on local tissue oxygen metabolism. To investigate the feasibility of determination of regional CMRO2 at a clinical 3 T MRI system, CMRO2 values in frontal, parietal and occipital WM and GM were determined in 5 healthy volunteers and compared to evaluate the regional differences of oxygen metabolism in WM and GM. Additionally, regional CMRO2 values were determined in deep brain structures including thalamus, dorsal striatum, caudate nucleus and insula cortex and in the cerebella, and compared with literature values from 15O-PET studies.'
