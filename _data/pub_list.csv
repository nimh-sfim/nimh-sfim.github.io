Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.</p>",https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001553/versions/1.0.0,,journal_article,10.1073/pnas.1121049109,

Non-invasive ways to improve tissue contrast in fMRI images include the use of low flip angles (FAs) well below the Ernst angle and longer repetition times (TR). Techniques to correct intensity inhomogeneity are also available in most mainstream fMRI data analysis packages; but are not used as part of the pre-processing pipeline in many studies. In this work, we use a combination of real data and simulations to show that simple-to- implement acquisition/pre-processing techniques can significantly improve the outcome of both functional-to-functional and anatomical-to-functional image registrations. In particular, we show that the use of low FAs (e.g., Œ∏<=40 degrees), when physiological noise considerations permit such an approach, significantly improves accuracy and consistency and stability of registration for data acquired at relatively short TRs (TR<=2s). Moreover, we also show that the application of bias correction techniques significantly improves alignment both for array-coil data (known to contain high intensity inhomogeneity) as well as birdcage-coil data. Finally, improvements in alignment derived from the use of the first infinite-TR volumes (ITVs) as targets for registration are also demonstrated. For the purpose of quantitatively evaluating the different scenarios, two novel metrics were developed: Mean Voxel Distance (MVD) to evaluate registration consistency, and Deviation of Mean Voxel Distance (dMVD) to evaluate registration stability across successive alignment attempts.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.076,

A retinal centric view on the physiological source of afterimages is dominant. In addition, post-retinal mechanisms have been considered in the formation and modulation of afterimage perception, including cortical processes. A cortical role in afterimage perception posits possible shared neural mechanisms between afterimages and other conscious perceptions that emerge completely from central neural sources (e.g., imagery, hallucination, and dreams). To examine this hypothesis, we tested a perceptual link between afterimages and visual imagery. Framing the current experiment, we review more than a century of literature that evidences post-retinal processes in afterimage perception. Subsequently, we present an innovative afterimage perception reporting paradigm, validated on image stimuli, that allowed participants to indicate the perceived sharpness, contrast, and duration of their afterimages. From these perceptual reports, we discovered a novel category of evidence for cortical mechanisms in afterimage perception: the vividness of visual imagery positively correlates with afterimage brightness and sharpness. This result motivates future investigations on the neural mechanisms of afterimage perception and encourages implementing afterimages as a model perception to interrogate other kinds of conscious experience with known cortical origin.</p>",https://github.com/nimh-sfim/Afterimage-Imagery-Behavioral,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/Afterimage-Imagery-Behavioral,journal_article,https://doi.org/10.1093/nc/niae032,consciousness

The Two-Level Theory of verb meaning: An approach to integrating the semantics of action with the mirror neuron system,"D. Kemmerer, J. Gonzalez-Castillo",javier_gonzalez-castillo,2010-01-01,Brain and Language,112.0,54-76,,,"<p>Verbs have two separate levels of meaning. One level reflects the uniqueness of every verb and is called the 'root'. The other level consists of a more austere representation that is shared by all the verbs in a given class and is called the 'event structure template'. We explore the following hypotheses about how, with specific reference to the motor features of action verbs, these two distinct levels of semantic representation might correspond to two distinct levels of the mirror neuron system. Hypothesis 1: Root-level motor features of verb meaning are partially subserved by somatotopically mapped mirror neurons in the left primary motor and/or premotor cortices. Hypothesis 2: Template-level motor features of verb meaning are partially subserved by representationally more schematic mirror neurons in Brodmann area 44 of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Evidence has been accumulating in support of the general neuroanatomical claims made by these two hypotheses-namely, that each level of verb meaning is associated with the designated cortical areas. However, as yet no studies have satisfied all the criteria necessary to support the more specific neurobiological claims made by the two hypotheses-namely, that each level of verb meaning is associated with mirror neurons in the pertinent brain regions. This would require demonstrating that within those regions the same neuronal populations are engaged during (a) the linguistic processing of particular motor features of verb meaning, (b) the execution of actions with the corresponding motor features, and (c) the observation of actions with the corresponding motor features.</p>",,,journal_article,,

How this ongoing experience shapes rsfMRI summary metrics (e.g., functional connectivity) is unknown, yet likely to contribute uniquely to within- and between-subject differences. Here we argue that understanding the role of ongoing experience in rsfMRI requires access to standardized, temporally resolved, scientifically validated first-person descriptions of those experiences. We suggest best practices for obtaining those descriptions via introspective methods appropriately adapted for use in fMRI research.

One of the more challenging aspects of the use of this technique is the application to studies involving acoustic stimulation, given that the measurement process generates acoustic noise of high intensity that can mask or otherwise impede perception and comprehension of a desired auditory stimulus. Advances in attenuation, acquisition strategies and experimental design have enhanced the use of fMRI in this context, with recent advances in active noise cancellation and our understanding of the fMRI-assessed hemodynamic response laying a framework for continued improvement.</p>",,,journal_article,,

To investigate the feasibility of determination of regional CMRO2 at a clinical 3 T MRI system, CMRO2 values in frontal, parietal and occipital WM and GM were determined in 5 healthy volunteers and compared to evaluate the regional differences of oxygen metabolism in WM and GM. Additionally, regional CMRO2 values were determined in deep brain structures including thalamus, dorsal striatum, caudate nucleus and insula cortex and in the cerebella, and compared with literature values from 15O-PET studies.",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.zemedi.2023.07.004,

Knight","daniel_handwerker, david_knight",2007-01-01,NeuroImage,34.0,1545-1561,,,"<p>This work addresses the choice of imaging flip angle in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). When noise of physiological origin becomes the dominant noise source in fMRI timeseries, it causes a nonlinear dependence of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that can be exploited to perform BOLD fMRI at angles well below the Ernst angle without any detrimental effect on our ability to detect sites of neuronal activation. We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that for situations where available SNR is high and physiological noise dominates over system/thermal noise, although TSNR still reaches it maximum for the Ernst angle, reduction of imaging flip angle well below this angle results in negligible loss in TSNR. Moreover, we provide a way to compute a suggested imaging flip angle, which constitutes a conservative estimate of the minimum flip angle that can be used under given experimental SNR and physiological noise levels. For our experimental conditions, this suggested angle equals 7.63 degrees for the grey matter compartment, while the Ernst angle=77 degrees. Finally, using data from eight subjects with a combined visual-motor task we show that imaging at angles as low as 9 degrees introduces no significant differences in observed hemodynamic response time-course, contrast-to-noise ratio, voxel-wise effect size or statistical maps of activation as compared to imaging at 75 degrees (an angle close to the Ernst angle). These results suggest that using low flip angles in BOLD fMRI experimentation to obtain benefits such as (1) reduction of RF power, (2) limitation of apparent T(1)-related inflow effects, (3) reduction of through-plane motion artifacts, (4) lower levels of physiological noise, and (5) improved tissue contrast is feasible when physiological noise dominates and SNR is high.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.10.020,

Talavage",javier_gonzalez-castillo,2011-01-01,Hearing Research,277.0,67-77,,,"<p>A confounding factor in auditory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is the presence of the acoustic noise inherently associated with the echo planar imaging acquisition technique. Previous studies have demonstrated that this noise can induce unwanted neuronal responses that can mask stimulus-induced responses. Similarly, activation accumulated over multiple stimuli has been demonstrated to elevate the baseline, thus reducing the dynamic range available for subsequent responses. To best evaluate responses to auditory stimuli, it is necessary to account for the presence of all recent acoustic stimulation, beginning with an understanding of the attenuating effects brought about by interaction between and among induced unwanted neuronal responses, and responses to desired auditory stimuli. This study focuses on the characterization of the duration of this temporal memory and qualitative assessment of the associated response attenuation. Two experimental parameters-inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and repetition time (TR)-were varied during an fMRI experiment in which participants were asked to passively attend to an auditory stimulus. Results present evidence of a state-dependent interaction between induced responses. As expected, attenuating effects of these interactions become less significant as TR and ISI increase and in contrast to previous work, persist up to 18s after a stimulus presentation.</p>",,,journal_article,,

One cognitive process, not yet investigated, is the mental representation of 'Yes/No' thoughts that precede the actual overt response to a binary 'Yes/No' question. In this study, we focus on examining: (1) whether spatial patterns of the hemodynamic response carry sufficient information to allow reliable decoding of 'Yes/No' thoughts; and (2) whether decoding of 'Yes/No' thoughts is independent of the intention to respond honestly or dishonestly. To achieve this goal, we conducted two separate experiments. Experiment 1, collected on a 3T scanner, examined the whole brain to identify regions that carry sufficient information to permit significantly above-chance prediction of 'Yes/No' thoughts at the group level. In Experiment 2, collected on a 7T scanner, we focused on the regions identified in Experiment 1 to examine the capability of achieving high decoding accuracy at the single subject level. A set of regions - namely right superior temporal gyrus, left supra-marginal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus - exhibited high decoding power. Decoding accuracy for these regions increased with trial averaging. When 18 trials were averaged, the median accuracies were 82.5%, 77.5%, and 79.5%, respectively. When trials were separated according to deceptive intentions (set via experimental cues), and classifiers were trained on honest trials, but tested on trials where subjects were asked to deceive, the median accuracies of these regions still reached 66%, 75%, and 78.5%. These results provide evidence that concealed 'Yes/No' thoughts are encoded in the BOLD signal, retaining some level of independence from the subject's intentions to answer honestly or dishonestly. These findings also suggest the theoretical possibility for more efficient brain-computer interfaces where subjects only need to think their answers to communicate.</p>",,,journal_article,,

Auditory neuroimaging with fMRI and PET,"T. Talavage, J. Gonzalez-Castillo, S. Scott",javier_gonzalez-castillo,2014-01-01,Hearing research,307.0,15-Apr,,,"<p>For much of the past 30 years, investigations of auditory perception and language have been enhanced or even driven by the use of functional neuroimaging techniques that specialize in localization of central responses. Beginning with investigations using positron emission tomography (PET) and gradually shifting primarily to usage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), auditory neuroimaging has greatly advanced our understanding of the organization and response properties of brain regions critical to the perception of and communication with the acoustic world in which we live. As the complexity of the questions being addressed has increased, the techniques, experiments and analyses applied have also become more nuanced and specialized. A brief review of the history of these investigations sets the stage for an overview and analysis of how these neuroimaging modalities are becoming ever more effective tools for understanding the auditory brain. We conclude with a brief discussion of open methodological issues as well as potential clinical applications for auditory neuroimaging.

This study is an exploration of the feasibility of direct detection of neuronal current induced NMR phase and/or magnitude changes. Our analysis was based on the approximation that neurons exist in an infinite homogeneous conducting medium, and are represented by an infinitely long cylindrical conductor, carrying uniform current. Neuronal activation was modeled by a current dipole. Simulations were performed to evaluate the effects of the local neuronal magnetic fields on the MRI signal at 3T. The magnetic field changes and the corresponding phase changes induced from a current range of 2 nA to 100 (mu) A were estimated. The conductor diameter was varied from 10 micrometer to 1 mm corresponding to the sizes ranging from that of a single axon to that of a patch of functionally similar cortex. Current induced magnetic field effects were assessed as resolution and neuronal orientation with respect to Bo were modulated. Simulation results were compared with measurements obtained from a current phantom at 3T, for a current range of 10 - 100 (mu) A. Based on the dipole model formulated we found that neuronal currents can produce magnetic fields on the order of 1.3 pT; 0.0006 degree(s) to 9 nT; 4 degree(s) depending on the neuronal bundle diameter, orientation, and current capacity. The mechanism for signal changes is that of Bo shifts. This is fundamentally similar to that of BOLD contrast, but caused by current changes rather than susceptibility changes from changes in blood oxygenation. If the bundles are of random orientations within a voxel, the estimated fields and NMR magnitude changes (decrease in T2*) are on the order of present system detection levels of approximately 1nT; 0.5 degree(s) or 0.01% signal change. Conversely, if the bundle orientation is homogeneous, then neuronal current effects are above system detection levels. The spatial scale of the current distribution also determines the net phase shift and magnitude change. The simulation and phantom experiment results demonstrated the feasibility of using MRI to directly detect local magnetic field perturbations that can result from neuronal currents on the order of a few (mu) A. This study provides a simple model for the evaluation of the feasibility to directly measure neuronal currents with MRI. Additionally it gives a starting point for the design of appropriate imaging methods towards detecting low signal level neuronal currents. A more extensive modeling of cortical and neuronal geometry, tissue inhomogeneity, timing mechanisms, and current distributions, will provide further insight in the development of MRI experimental techniques.",,,journal_article,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.428136,

Recently, a family of data-driven analyses have provided such reliable measures when applied to large, population-level datasets. In the current pre-registered replication study, we show that the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods previously developed using resting-state magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity and subject measures (SMs) of cognition and behaviour from healthy adults are also effective in measuring well-being (a 'positive-negative axis') in an independent developmental dataset. Our replication was successful in two out of three of our pre-registered criteria, such that a primary CCA mode's weights displayed a significant positive relationship and explained a significant amount of variance in both functional connectivity and SMs. The only criterion that was not successful was that compared to other modes the magnitude of variance explained by the primary CCA mode was smaller than predicted, a result that could indicate a developmental trajectory of a primary mode. This replication establishes a signature neurotypical relationship between connectivity and phenotype, opening new avenues of research in neuroscience with clear clinical applications.",,,journal_article,10.1098/rsos.201090,bold_connectivity_dynamics

Holo-Hilbert spectral-based noise removal method for EEG high-frequency bands,"Narges Moradi, Pierre LeVan, Burak Akin, Bradley Goodyear, Roberto Sotero",burak_akin,2022-01-01,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,368.0,109470,,,"Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a growing and promising field, as it has great potential to further our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain function in health and disease. In particular, there is much interest in understanding the fMRI correlates of brain activity in the gamma band (>30 Hz), as these frequencies are thought to be associated with cognitive processes involving perception, attention, and memory, as well as with disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. However, progress in this area has been limited due to issues such as MR-induced artifacts in EEG recordings, which seem to be more problematic for gamma frequencies. This paper presents a noise removal method for the gamma band of EEG that is based on the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA), but with a new implementation strategy. HHSA uses a nested empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to identify amplitude and frequency modulations (AM and FM, respectively) by averaging over frequencies with high and significant powers. Our method examines gamma band by applying two layers of EMD to the FM and AM components, removing components with very low power based on the power-instantaneous frequency spectrum, and subsequently reconstructs the denoised gamma-band signal from the remaining components. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed method efficiently reduces artifacts while preserving the original gamma signal which is especially critical for simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies.",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109470,

Consequently, connectivity patterns for two different portions of the same scan can differ drastically. To better characterize this temporal variability and understand how it is spatially distributed across the brain, we scanned subjects continuously for 60 min, at a temporal resolution of 1 s, while they rested inside the scanner. We then computed connectivity matrices between functionally-defined regions of interest for non-overlapping 1 min windows, and classified connections according to their strength, polarity, and variability. We found that the most stable connections correspond primarily to inter-hemispheric connections between left/right homologous ROIs. However, only 32% of all within-network connections were classified as most stable. This shows that resting state networks have some long-term stability, but confirms the flexible configuration of these networks, particularly those related to higher order cognitive functions. The most variable connections correspond primarily to inter-hemispheric, across-network connections between non-homologous regions in occipital and frontal cortex. Finally we found a series of connections with negative average correlation, but further analyses revealed that such average negative correlations may be related to the removal of CSF signals during pre-processing. Using the same dataset, we also evaluated how similarity of within-subject whole-brain connectivity matrices changes as a function of window duration (used here as a proxy for scan duration). Our results suggest scanning for a minimum of 10 min to optimize within-subject reproducibility of connectivity patterns across the entire brain, rather than a few predefined networks.</p>",,,journal_article,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2014.00138,bold_connectivity_dynamics

The speech processor, in conjunction with isolating insert earphones and a microphone to capture environment sounds, was worn by participants over a two week chronic exposure period. fMRI and behavioral speech comprehension testing were conducted before and after this two week period. After using the simulator each day for 2h, participants significantly improved in word and sentence recognition scores. fMRI shows that these improvements came accompanied by changes in patterns of neuronal activation. In particular, we found additional recruitment of visual, motor, and working memory areas after the perceptual training period. These findings suggest that the human brain is able to adapt in a short period of time to a degraded auditory signal under a natural learning environment, and gives insight on how a CI might interact with the central nervous system. This paradigm can be furthered to investigate neural correlates of new rehabilitation, training, and signal processing strategies non-invasively in normal hearing listeners to improve CI patient outcomes.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.001,

Here, we propose to generate the anatomical image with the fMRI acquisition technique by incorporating magnetization transfer (MT) weighted imaging. Small flip angle binomial pulse trains are used as MT preparation, with a flexible duration (several to tens of milliseconds), which can be applied before each EPI segment without constraining the acquisition length (segment or slice number).

To reconcile these observations, we use wide-field optical mapping to simultaneously record pan-cortical neuronal and hemodynamic activity in awake, spontaneously behaving mice. Some components of observed neuronal activity clearly represent sensory and motor function. However, particularly during quiet rest, strongly fluctuating patterns of activity across diverse brain regions contribute greatly to interregional correlations. Dynamic changes in these correlations coincide with changes in arousal state. Simultaneously acquired hemodynamics depict similar brain-state-dependent correlation shifts.

Inter-subject correlation during long narratives reveals widespread neural correlates of reading ability,"David Jangraw, Emily Finn, Peter Bandettini, Nicole Landi, Haorui Sun, Fumiko Hoeft, Gang Chen, Kenneth Pugh, Peter Molfese","david_jangraw, emily_finn, peter_bandettini, peter_molfese",2023-01-01,NeuroImage,282.0,120390,,,"Recent work using fMRI inter-subject correlation analysis has provided new information about the brain's response to video and audio narratives, particularly in frontal regions not typically activated by single words. This approach is very well suited to the study of reading, where narrative is central to natural experience. But since past reading paradigms have primarily presented single words or phrases, the influence of narrative on semantic processing in the brain - and how that influence might change with reading ability - remains largely unexplored. In this study, we presented coherent stories to adolescents and young adults with a wide range of reading abilities. The stories were presented in alternating visual and auditory blocks. We used a dimensional inter-subject correlation analysis to identify regions in which better and worse readers had varying levels of consistency with other readers. This analysis identified a widespread set of brain regions in which activity timecourses were more similar among better readers than among worse readers. These differences were not detected with standard block activation analyses. Worse readers had higher correlation with better readers than with other worse readers, suggesting that the worse readers had 'idiosyncratic' responses rather than using a single compensatory mechanism. Close inspection confirmed that these differences were not explained by differences in IQ or motion. These results suggest an expansion of the current view of where and how reading ability is reflected in the brain, and in doing so, they establish inter-subject correlation as a sensitive tool for future studies of reading disorders.",https://osf.io/qk5yd/,https://github.com/djangraw/ReadingAbilityIsc,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120390,

In human primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b), different cortical layers are involved in receiving the sensory input and generation of error signals. It remains unknown, however, how the layers in the human area 3b contribute to the temporal prediction error processing. To investigate prediction error representation in the area 3b across layers, we acquired layer-specific functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data at 7T from human area 3b during a task of index finger poking with no-delay, short-delay and long-delay touching sequences. We demonstrate that all three tasks increased activity in both superficial and deep layers of area 3b compared to the random sensory input. The fMRI signal was differentially modulated solely in the deep layers rather than the superficial layers of area 3b by the delay time. Compared with the no-delay stimuli, activity was greater in the deep layers of area 3b during the short-delay stimuli but lower during the long-delay stimuli. This difference activity features in the superficial and deep layers suggest distinct functional contributions of area 3b layers to tactile temporal prediction error processing. The functional segregation in area 3b across layers may reflect that the excitatory and inhibitory interplay in the sensory cortex contributions to flexible communication between cortical layers or between cortical areas.",,,journal_article,doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118867,layer_fmri

Ultra-slow fMRI fluctuations in the fourth ventricle as a marker of drowsiness,"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo, Isabel Fernandez, Daniel Handwerker, Peter Bandettini","javier_gonzalez-castillo, isabel_fernandez, daniel_handwerker, peter_bandettini",2022-01-01,NeuroImage,259.0,119424,,,"<p>Wakefulness levels modulate estimates of <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/functional-connectivity'>functional connectivity</a> (FC), and, if unaccounted for, can become a substantial confound in resting-state fMRI. Unfortunately, wakefulness is rarely monitored due to the need for additional concurrent recordings (e.g., eye tracking, EEG). Recent work has shown that strong fluctuations around 0.05Hz, hypothesized to be <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cerebrospinal-fluid'>CSF</a> inflow, appear in the <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/fourth-ventricle'>fourth ventricle</a> (FV) when subjects fall asleep, and that they correlate significantly with the global signal. The analysis of these fluctuations could provide an easy way to evaluate wakefulness in fMRI-only data and improve our understanding of FC during sleep. Here we evaluate this possibility using the 7T resting-state sample from the Human <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/connectome'>Connectome</a> Project (HCP). Our results replicate the observation that fourth ventricle ultra-slow fluctuations (‚àº0.05Hz) with inflow-like characteristics (decreasing in intensity for successive slices) are present in scans during which subjects did not comply with instructions to keep their eyes open (i.e., drowsy scans). This is true despite the HCP data not being optimized for the detection of inflow-like effects. In addition, time-locked BOLD fluctuations of the same frequency could be detected in large portions of grey matter with a wide range of temporal delays and contribute in significant ways to our understanding of how FC changes during sleep. First, these ultra-slow fluctuations explain half of the increase in global signal that occurs during descent into sleep. Similarly, global shifts in FC between awake and sleep states are driven by changes in this slow frequency band. Second, they can influence estimates of inter-regional FC. For example, disconnection between frontal and posterior components of the Defulat Mode Network (DMN) typically reported during sleep were only detectable after regression of these ultra-slow fluctuations. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the power spectrum of these ultra-slow FV fluctuations can help us reproduce sample-level sleep patterns (e.g., a substantial number of subjects descending into sleep 3 minutes following scanning onset), partially rank scans according to overall drowsiness levels, and predict individual segments of elevated drowsiness (at 60 seconds resolution) with 71% accuracy.</p> <p><a href='https://github.com/nimh-sfim/hcp7t_fv_sleep'>Code</a></p>",,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/hcp7t_fv_sleep,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119424,bold_connectivity_dynamics
Modeling hemodynamic responses in auditory cortex at 1.5 T using variable duration imaging acoustic noise,"S. Hu, O. Olulade, J. Gonzalez-Castillo, J. Santos, S. Kim, G. Tamer, W. Luh, T. TM",javier_gonzalez-castillo,2010-01-01,Neuroimage,49.0,3027-38,,,"<p>A confound for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), especially for auditory studies, is the presence of imaging acoustic noise generated mainly as a byproduct of rapid gradient switching during volume acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the radiofrequency transmit. This work utilized a novel pulse sequence to present actual imaging acoustic noise for characterization of the induced hemodynamic responses and assessment of linearity in the primary auditory cortex with respect to noise duration. Results show that responses to brief duration (46 ms) imaging acoustic noise is highly nonlinear while responses to longer duration (>1 s) imaging acoustic noise becomes approximately linear, with the right primary auditory cortex exhibiting a higher degree of nonlinearity than the left for the investigated noise durations. This study also assessed the spatial extent of activation induced by imaging acoustic noise, showing that the use of modeled responses (specific to imaging acoustic noise) as the reference waveform revealed additional activations in the auditory cortex not observed with a canonical gamma variate reference waveform, suggesting an improvement in detection sensitivity for imaging acoustic noise-induced activity. Longer duration (1.5 s) imaging acoustic noise was observed to induce activity that expanded outwards from Heschl's gyrus to cover the superior temporal gyrus as well as parts of the middle temporal gyrus and insula, potentially affecting higher level acoustic processing.</p>",,,journal_article,,

They are thought to mediate responses to sustained, unpredictable threat stimuli and phasic, predictable threat stimuli, respectively. They perform these operations largely through their interconnected networks. In two previous studies, we mapped and contrasted the resting functional connectivity networks of the BNST and CeA at 7 Tesla with high resolution. This follow-up study investigates the changes in functional connectivity of these structures during sustained anticipation of electric shock. Results show that the BNST and CeA become less strongly coupled with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), cingulate, and nucleus accumbens in shock threat relative to a safety condition. In addition, the CeA becomes more strongly coupled with the thalamus under threat. An exploratory, whole-brain connectivity analysis reveals that, although the BNST/CeA exhibits generally decreased connectivity, many other cortical regions demonstrate greater coupling under threat than safety. Understanding the differential network structures of these two regions and how they contribute to processing under threat will help elucidate the building blocks of the anxious state.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1038/s41398-017-0074-6,

These changes in brain function involve increased synchronization between cortical areas 6,7 as well as alterations in sensory processing pathways and networks connecting the thalamus and cortex 5,8-11. Cognitive tasks engage overlapping functional networks with sensory pathways facilitating information processing 12,13, and thalamocortical and corticocortical networks supporting task performance 14,15. Frontoparietal circuits play a crucial role in cognitive tasks 16 and states of decreased consciousness 17. To develop an integrated framework of consciousness and cognition, it is important to understand how fluctuations in alertness and cognitive processing interact in these shared circuits 18. Our hypothesis is that during periods of low alertness, individuals who actively maintain task engagement would recruit additional frontoparietal and sensory processing networks, while thalamocortical dynamics that typically change during sleep onset would remain unaffected. Our findings demonstrated that as alertness decreased, passively listening to auditory tones led to increased synchronization in the parietal lobe, whereas actively performing an auditory task resulted in increased long-range frontoparietal synchronization. During decreasing alertness, passive listening (but not active task engagement) was associated with widespread increased synchronization between the thalamus and cortex. In contrast, active task engagement (but not passive listening) led to increased synchronization between the auditory cortex and the rest of the brain. These results reveal the functional mechanisms of the brain's flexible reorganization during transitions of consciousness when individuals are actively engaged in cognitive processes.",,,journal_article,https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.08.544178,consciousness

To study why, the fMRI field is beginning to turn from single-word or nonword reading tasks to naturalistic stimuli like connected text and listening to stories. To study reading development in children just beginning to read, listening to stories is an appropriate paradigm because speech perception and phonological processing are important for, and are predictors of, reading proficiency. Our study examined the relationship between behavioral reading-related skills and the neural response to listening to stories in the fMRI environment. Functional MRI were gathered in a 3T TIM-Trio scanner. During the fMRI scan, children aged approximately 7 years listened to professionally narrated common short stories and answered comprehension questions following the narration. Analyses of the data used inter-subject correlation (ISC), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Our primary finding is that ISC reveals areas of increased synchrony in both high- and low-performing emergent readers previously implicated in reading ability/disability. Of particular interest are that several previously identified brain regions (medial temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG)) were found to 'synchronize' across higher reading ability participants, while lower reading ability participants had idiosyncratic activation patterns in these regions. Additionally, two regions (superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and another portion of ITG) were recruited by all participants, but their specific timecourse of activation depended on reading performance. These analyses support the idea that different brain regions involved in reading follow different developmental trajectories that correlate with reading proficiency on a spectrum rather than the usual dichotomy of poor readers versus strong readers.",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108763,

Our results with experimental data demonstrate that the maps of R changes obtained with ME-PFM at the times of the stimulus trials closely resemble the maps obtained with a standard approach that is aware of the onsets and durations of the events. Compared with previous deconvolution approaches for BOLD fMRI, this method yields estimates of R changes in physiologically interpretable units, which is particularly relevant for the quantification of the dynamics of the BOLD fMRI signal during tasks and resting state.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363649,multi_echo

Whole-brain multivariate hemodynamic deconvolution for multi-echo fMRI with stability selection,"Eneko Uruñuela, Javier Gonzalez-Castillo, Charles Zheng, Peter Bandettini, Cesar Caballero-Gaudes","javier_gonzalez-castillo, peter_bandettini",2024-01-01,Medical Image Analysis,92.0,,,,"Conventionally, analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data relies on available information about the experimental paradigm to establish hypothesized models of brain activity. However, this information can be inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable in multiple scenarios such as resting-state, naturalistic paradigms or clinical conditions. In these cases, blind estimates of neuronal-related activity can be obtained with paradigm-free analysis methods such as hemodynamic deconvolution. Yet, current formulations of the hemodynamic deconvolution problem have three important limitations: 1) their efficacy strongly depends on the appropriate selection of regularization parameters, 2) being univariate, they do not take advantage of the information present across the brain, and 3) they do not provide any measure of statistical certainty associated with each detected event. Here we propose a novel approach that addresses all these limitations. Specifically, we introduce MvME-SPFM (multivariate multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping), a novel hemodynamic deconvolution algorithm that operates at the whole brain level and adds spatial information via a mixed-norm regularization term over all voxels. Additionally, MvME-SPFM employs a stability selection procedure that removes the need to select regularization parameters and also lets us obtain an estimate of the true probability of having a neuronal-related BOLD event at each voxel and time-point based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths. Besides, the formulation is tailored for multi-echo fMRI acquisitions, which allows us to better isolate fluctuations of BOLD origin on the basis of their linear dependence with Echo Time (TE) and to assign physiologically interpretable units (i.e., changes in the apparent transverse relaxation) to the resulting deconvolved events. We demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art deconvolution approaches, and shows higher spatial and temporal agreement with the activation maps and BOLD signals obtained with a standard model-based linear regression approach, even at the level of individual neuronal events. Consequently, the proposed algorithm provides more reliable estimates of neuronal-related activity, here in terms of , for the study of the dynamics of brain activity when no information about the timings of the BOLD events is available. This algorithm will be made publicly available as part of the splora Python package.",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.media.2023.103010,multi_echo

Notably, they demonstrate that linear combinations of geometric modes can reconstruct patterns of fMRI data more accurately, and with fewer dimensions, than comparable connectivity-derived modes. Equipped with these results, and underpinned by neural field theory, the authors contend that the geometry of the cortical surface provides a more parsimonious explanation of brain activity than structural brain connectivity. This claim runs counter to prevailing theories of information flow in the brain, which emphasize the role of long-distance axonal projections and fasciculated white matter in relaying signals between cortical regions (<a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.20.549785v1#ref-9'>Honey et al. 2009</a>; <a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.20.549785v1#ref-5'>Deco et al. 2011</a>; <a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.20.549785v1#ref-18'>Seguin et al., 2023</a>).

Here, we provide 1) a brief critique of the paper‚Äôs framing and 2) evidence showing that their methodology lacks specificity to the brain‚Äôs orientation and shape. Ultimately, we recognize that the geometric mode approach is a powerful representational framework for brain dynamics analysis, but we also believe that there are key caveats to consider alongside the claims made in the manuscript.</p>",,https://github.com/faskowit/eigenmodes_nulls,journal_article,https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.20.549785,bold_connectivity_dynamics

With an increase in neuronal activity, blood flow increases, causing an increase in blood oxygenation, leading to an increase in transverse relaxation rate T2*. This increase in blood flow is slow and highly variable and shows a considerable spatial heterogeneity. In spite of these limitations, the hemodynamic response has been proven to be exquisitely sensitive to subtle differences in neuronal activity in time, over space, and between subjects. This paper is a brief review of my Keynote address describing some of the effort coming from my group that further demonstrates methods to robustly extract ever more information from both resting state fMRI and activation-induced fMRI. Specifically, I discuss 1) our new method to use multi-echo fMRI time series data collection to separate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal from non-BOLD signal, 2) activation of the whole brain obtained using a simple task and, importantly massive averaging and a model-free analysis approach, and 3) fMRI decoding of left vs right eye ocular dominance column activation with a timing offset as low as 100 ms.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1117/12.2012737,

As FMRI research trends toward studies with larger sample sizes and highly automated processing pipelines, the people who analyze data are often distinct from those who collect and preprocess the data. While there are good reasons for this trend, it also means that important information about how data were acquired, and their quality, may be missed by those working at later stages of these workflows. Similarly, an abundance of publicly available datasets, where people (not always correctly) assume others already validated data quality, makes it easier for trainees to advance in the field without learning how to identify problematic data. This manuscript is designed as an introduction for researchers who are already familiar with fMRI, but who did not get hands on QC training or who want to think more deeply about QC. This could be someone who has analyzed fMRI data but is planning to personally acquire data for the first time, or someone who regularly uses openly shared data and wants to learn how to better assess data quality. We describe why good QC processes are important, explain key priorities and steps for fMRI QC, and as part of the FMRI Open QC Project, we demonstrate some of these steps by using AFNI software and AFNI's QC reports on an openly shared dataset. A good QC process is context dependent and should address whether data have the potential to answer a scientific question, whether any variation in the data has the potential to skew or hide key results, and whether any problems can potentially be addressed through changes in acquisition or data processing. Automated metrics are essential and can often highlight a possible problem, but human interpretation at every stage of a study is vital for understanding causes and potential solutions.",https://osf.io/qaesm/,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/SFIM_Frontiers_Neuroimaging_QC_Project,journal_article,10.3389/fnins.2023.1100544,education

Traditional theories hold that facial viewpoint is represented by view-selective mechanisms at early visual processing stages and that representations become increasingly tolerant to viewpoint changes in higher-level visual areas. Newer theories, based on single-neuron monkey electrophysiological recordings, suggest an additional intermediate processing stage invariant to mirror-symmetric face views. Consistent with traditional theories, human studies combining neuroimaging and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods have provided evidence of view-selectivity in early visual cortex. However, contradictory results have been reported in higher-level visual areas concerning the existence in humans of mirror-symmetrically tuned representations. We believe these results reflect low-level stimulus confounds and data analysis choices. To probe for low-level confounds, we analyzed images from two popular face databases. Analyses of mean image luminance and contrast revealed biases across face views described by even polynomials, - i.e., mirror-symmetric. To explain major trends across human neuroimaging studies of viewpoint selectivity, we constructed a network model that incorporates three biological constraints: cortical magnification, convergent feedforward projections, and interhemispheric connections. Given the identified low-level biases, we show that a gradual increase of interhemispheric connections across network layers is sufficient to replicate findings of mirror-symmetry in high-level processing stages, as well as view-tuning in early processing stages. Data analysis decisions - pattern dissimilarity measure and data recentering - accounted for the variable observation of mirror-symmetry in late processing stages. The model provides a unifying explanation of MVPA studies of viewpoint selectivity. We also show how common analysis choices can lead to erroneous conclusions.</p>",,https://github.com/toporam/model-crossings,journal_article,https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0296-23.2024,

Recent work has shown that strong fluctuations around 0.05Hz, hypothesized to be CSF inflow, appear in the fourth ventricle (FV) when subjects fall asleep, and that they correlate significantly with the global signal. The analysis of these fluctuations could provide an easy way to evaluate wakefulness in fMRI-only data and improve our understanding of FC during sleep. Here we evaluate this possibility using the 7T resting-state sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results replicate the observation that fourth ventricle ultra-slow fluctuations (∼0.05Hz) with inflow-like characteristics (decreasing in intensity for successive slices) are present in scans during which subjects did not comply with instructions to keep their eyes open (i.e., drowsy scans). This is true despite the HCP data not being optimized for the detection of inflow-like effects. In addition, time-locked BOLD fluctuations of the same frequency could be detected in large portions of grey matter with a wide range of temporal delays and contribute in significant ways to our understanding of how FC changes during sleep. First, these ultra-slow fluctuations explain half of the increase in global signal that occurs during descent into sleep. Similarly, global shifts in FC between awake and sleep states are driven by changes in this slow frequency band. Second, they can influence estimates of inter-regional FC. For example, disconnection between frontal and posterior components of the Defulat Mode Network (DMN) typically reported during sleep were only detectable after regression of these ultra-slow fluctuations. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the power spectrum of these ultra-slow FV fluctuations can help us reproduce sample-level sleep patterns (e.g., a substantial number of subjects descending into sleep 3 minutes following scanning onset), partially rank scans according to overall drowsiness levels, and predict individual segments of elevated drowsiness (at 60 seconds resolution) with 71% accuracy.",,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/hcp7t_fv_sleep,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119424,bold_connectivity_dynamics

(Science, 378, 160-168, 2022) reported direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA) by fMRI in anesthetized mice at 9.4 T, which could be a revolutionary approach for advancing systems neuroscience research. There have been no independent replications of this observation to date. We performed fMRI experiments in anesthetized mice at an ultrahigh field of 15.2 T using the identical protocol as in their paper. The BOLD response to whisker stimulation was reliably detected in the primary barrel cortex before and after DIANA experiments; however, no direct neuronal activity-like fMRI peak was observed in individual animals' data with the 50-300 trials used in the DIANA publication. Extensively averaged data involving 1,050 trials in 6 mice (1,050_54 = 56,700 stimulus events) and having a temporal signal-to-noise ratio of 7,370, showed a flat baseline and no detectable neuronal activity-like fMRI peak. Thus we were unable to replicate the previously reported results using the same methods, despite a much higher number of trials, a much higher temporal signal-to-noise ratio, and a much higher magnetic field strength. We were able to demonstrate spurious, non-replicable peaks when using a small number of trials. It was only when performing the inappropriate approach of excluding outliers not conforming to the expected temporal characteristics of the response did we see a clear signal change; however, these signals were not observed when such a outlier elimination approach was not used.",,,journal_article,10.1126/sciadv.adl0999,

We argue that by collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain's dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level - as an interactive representation - without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4-9 s) than before. The individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into interactive and behaviorally relevant representations",,,journal_article,10.1038/s41467-018-03664-4,bold_connectivity_dynamics

Reproducibility of fMRI activations associated with auditory sentence comprehension,"J. Gonzalez-Castillo, T.

While in the scanner subjects were asked to listen to a series of six short everyday sentences from the CUNY sentence test. Comprehension and attention to the stimuli were monitored after each listen condition epoch by having subjects answer a series of multiple-choice questions. Statistical maps of activation for the listen condition were computed at three different levels: overall results for all imaging sessions, group-level/single-session results for each of the five imaging occasions, and single-subject/single-session results computed for each subject and each scanning occasion independently. The experimental task recruited a distributed bilateral network with processing nodes located in the lateral temporal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, medial BA6, medial occipital cortex and subcortical structures such as the putamen and the thalamus. Reproducibility of these activations at the group level was high (83.95% of the imaged volume was consistently classified as active/inactive across all five imaging sessions), indicating that sites of neuronal activity associated with auditory comprehension can reliably be detected with fMRI in healthy subjects, across repeated measures after group averaging. At the single-subject level reproducibility ranged from moderate to high, although no significant differences were found on behavioral measures across subjects or sessions. This result suggests that contextual differences-i.e., those specific to each imaging session, can modulate our ability to detect fMRI activations associated with speech comprehension in individual subjects.</p>",,,journal_article,,

Recent findings have indicated, however, that even small (<=1 mm) amounts of head movement during scanning can disproportionately bias connectivity estimates, despite various preprocessing efforts. Further complications for interregional connectivity estimation from time domain signals include the unaccounted reduction in BOLD degrees of freedom related to sensitivity losses from high subject motion. To address these issues, we describe an integrated strategy for data acquisition, denoising, and connectivity estimation. This strategy builds on our previously published technique combining data acquisition with multiecho (ME) echo planar imaging and analysis with spatial independent component analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which distinguishes BOLD (neuronal) and non-BOLD (artifactual) components based on linear echo-time dependence of signals - a characteristic property of BOLD T2* signal changes. Here we show for 32 control subjects that this method provides a physically principled and nearly operator-independent way of removing complex artifacts such as motion from resting state data. We then describe a robust estimator of functional connectivity based on interregional correlation of BOLD-independent component coefficients. This estimator, called independent components regression, considerably simplifies statistical inference for functional connectivity because degrees of freedom equals the number of independent coefficients. Compared with traditional connectivity estimation methods, the proposed strategy results in fourfold improvements in signal-to-noise ratio, functional connectivity analysis with improved specificity, and valid statistical inference with nominal control of type 1 error in contrasts of connectivity between groups with different levels of subject motion.",,,journal_article,10.1073/pnas.1301725110,multi_echo

Nine subjects underwent fMRI scanning where they performed a sequential, oppositional finger-tapping task. The first five runs were conducted with the subject's head remaining stable inside the head coil. Following this, four more runs were collected after the subject removed and replaced his/her head inside the head coil before each run. The coefficient of variation was calculated for four metrics: the distance from the anterior commisure to the center of mass of sensorimotor activation, maximum t-statistic, activation volume, and average percent signal change. These values were compared for five head-stabilization runs and five head-repositioning runs. Voxelwise intraclass correlation coefficients were also calculated to assess the spatial distribution of sources of variance. Interestingly, head repositioning was not seen to significantly affect the reproducibility of fMRI activation (p<0.05). In addition, the threshold level affected the reproducibility of activation volume and percent signal change.</p>",,,journal_article,,

It has recently been found that whole-brain dynamic FC (dFC) patterns contain sufficient information to permit identification of ongoing tasks. Here, we hypothesize that dFC patterns carry fine-grained information that allows for tracking short-term task engagement levels (i.e., tens of seconds long). To test this hypothesis, twenty-five subjects were scanned continuously for 25 mins while they performed and transitioned between four different tasks: working memory, visual attention, math, and rest. First, we estimated dFC patterns using a sliding window approach. Next, we extracted two engagement-specific FC patterns representing active engagement and passive engagement using k-means clustering. Then, we derived three metrics from whole-brain dFC patterns to track engagement level, i.e. dissimilarity between dFC patterns and engagement-specific FC patterns, and the level of brainwide integration level. Finally, those engagement markers were evaluated against windowed task performance using a linear mixed effects model. Significant relationships were observed between abovementioned metrics and windowed task performance for the working memory task only. These findings partially confirm our hypothesis and underscore the potential of whole-brain dFC to track short-term task engagement levels.",,,journal_article,10.1162/NETN_a_00051,bold_connectivity_dynamics

Bodurka","javier_gonzalez-castillo, peter_bandettini",2011-01-01,NeuroImage,54.0,2778,,,"<p>This work addresses the choice of imaging flip angle in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). When noise of physiological origin becomes the dominant noise source in fMRI timeseries, it causes a nonlinear dependence of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that can be exploited to perform BOLD fMRI at angles well below the Ernst angle without any detrimental effect on our ability to detect sites of neuronal activation. We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that for situations where available SNR is high and physiological noise dominates over system/thermal noise, although TSNR still reaches it maximum for the Ernst angle, reduction of imaging flip angle well below this angle results in negligible loss in TSNR. Moreover, we provide a way to compute a suggested imaging flip angle, which constitutes a conservative estimate of the minimum flip angle that can be used under given experimental SNR and physiological noise levels. For our experimental conditions, this suggested angle equals 7.63 degrees for the grey matter compartment, while the Ernst angle=77 degrees. Finally, using data from eight subjects with a combined visual-motor task we show that imaging at angles as low as 9 degrees introduces no significant differences in observed hemodynamic response time-course, contrast-to-noise ratio, voxel-wise effect size or statistical maps of activation as compared to imaging at 75 degrees (an angle close to the Ernst angle). These results suggest that using low flip angles in BOLD fMRI experimentation to obtain benefits such as (1) reduction of RF power, (2) limitation of apparent T(1)-related inflow effects, (3) reduction of through-plane motion artifacts, (4) lower levels of physiological noise, and (5) improved tissue contrast is feasible when physiological noise dominates and SNR is high.</p>",,,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.020,

However, it is still unclear how the primary sensorimotor cortex (PSC) interacts with these higher-level regions during haptic exploration over time. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigates time-dependent haptic object processing by examining brain activity during haptic 3D curve and roughness estimations. For this experiment, we designed sixteen haptic stimuli (4 kinds of curves x 4 varieties of roughness) for the haptic curve and roughness estimation tasks. Twenty participants were asked to move their right index and middle fingers along the surface twice and to estimate one of the two features - roughness or curvature - depending on the task instruction. We found that the brain activity in several higher-level regions (e.g., the bilateral posterior parietal cortex) linearly increased as the number of curves increased during the haptic exploration phase. Surprisingly, we found that the contralateral PSC was parametrically modulated by the number of curves only during the late exploration phase but not during the early exploration phase. In contrast, we found no similar parametric modulation activity patterns during the haptic roughness estimation task in either the contralateral PSC or in higher-level regions. Thus, our findings suggest that haptic 3D object perception is processed across the cortical hierarchy, whereas the contralateral PSC interacts with other higher-level regions across time in a manner that is dependent upon the features of the object.",https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003466/versions/1.1.1,,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117754,

Manifold Learning for fMRI time-varying FC,"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo, Isabel Fernandez, Ka Lam, Daniel Handwerker, Francisco Pereira, Peter Bandettini","javier_gonzalez-castillo, isabel_fernandez, daniel_handwerker, peter_bandettini",2023-07-10,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,17.0,,,,"Whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) measured with functional MRI (fMRI) evolves over time in meaningful ways at temporal scales going from years (e.g., development) to seconds [e.g., within-scan time-varying FC (tvFC)]. Yet, our ability to explore tvFC is severely constrained by its large dimensionality (several thousands). To overcome this difficulty, researchers often seek to generate low dimensional representations (e.g., 2D and 3D scatter plots) hoping those will retain important aspects of the data (e.g., relationships to behavior and disease progression). Limited prior empirical work suggests that manifold learning techniques (MLTs) - namely those seeking to infer a low dimensional non-linear surface (i.e., the manifold) where most of the data lies - are good candidates for accomplishing this task. Here we explore this possibility in detail. First, we discuss why one should expect tvFC data to lie on a low dimensional manifold. Second, we estimate what is the intrinsic dimension (ID; i.e., minimum number of latent dimensions) of tvFC data manifolds. Third, we describe the inner workings of three state-of-the-art MLTs: Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEs), T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). For each method, we empirically evaluate its ability to generate neuro-biologically meaningful representations of tvFC data, as well as their robustness against hyper-parameter selection. Our results show that tvFC data has an ID that ranges between 4 and 26, and that ID varies significantly between rest and task states. We also show how all three methods can effectively capture subject identity and task being performed: UMAP and T-SNE can capture these two levels of detail concurrently, but LE could only capture one at a time. We observed substantial variability in embedding quality across MLTs, and within-MLT as a function of hyper-parameter selection. To help alleviate this issue, we provide heuristics that can inform future studies. Finally, we also demonstrate the importance of feature normalization when combining data across subjects and the role that temporal autocorrelation plays in the application of MLTs to tvFC data. Overall, we conclude that while MLTs can be useful to generate summary views of labeled tvFC data, their application to unlabeled data such as resting-state remains challenging.",,,journal_article,10.3389/fnhum.2023.1134012,bold_connectivity_dynamics

Neuroanatomical distribution of five semantic components of verbs: evidence from fMRI,"D. Kemmerer, J. Gonzalez-Castillo, T. Talavage, S. Patterson, C. Wiley","javier_gonzalez-castillo, james_patterson",2008-01-01,Brain and Language,1.0,16-43,,,"<p>The Simulation Framework, also known as the Embodied Cognition Framework, maintains that conceptual knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor systems. To test several predictions that this theory makes about the neural substrates of verb meanings, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan subjects' brains while they made semantic judgments involving five classes of verbs-specifically, Running verbs (e.g., run, jog, walk), Speaking verbs (e.g., shout, mumble, whisper), Hitting verbs (e.g., hit, poke, jab), Cutting verbs (e.g., cut, slice, hack), and Change of State verbs (e.g., shatter, smash, crack). These classes were selected because they vary with respect to the presence or absence of five distinct semantic components-specifically, ACTION, MOTION, CONTACT, CHANGE OF STATE, and TOOL USE. Based on the Simulation Framework, we hypothesized that the ACTION component depends on the primary motor and premotor cortices, that the MOTION component depends on the posterolateral temporal cortex, that the CONTACT component depends on the intraparietal sulcus and inferior parietal lobule, that the CHANGE OF STATE component depends on the ventral temporal cortex, and that the TOOL USE component depends on a distributed network of temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. Virtually all of the predictions were confirmed. Taken together, these findings support the Simulation Framework and extend our understanding of the neuroanatomical distribution of different aspects of verb meaning.</p>",,,journal_article,,
Trait paranoia shapes inter-subject synchrony in brain activity during an ambiguous social narrative,"Emily Finn, Philip R. Cortlett, Gang Chen, Peter A. Bandettini, R. Todd Constable","emily_finn, peter_bandettini",2018-01-12,Nature Communications,9.0,,,,"Individuals often interpret the same event in different ways. How do personality traits modulate brain activity evoked by a complex stimulus? Here we report results from a naturalistic paradigm designed to draw out both neural and behavioral variation along a specific dimension of interest, namely paranoia. Participants listen to a narrative during functional MRI describing an ambiguous social scenario, written such that some individuals would find it highly suspicious, while others less so. Using inter-subject correlation analysis, we identify several brain areas that are differentially synchronized during listening between participants with high and low trait-level paranoia, including theory-of-mind regions. Follow-up analyses indicate that these regions are more active to mentalizing events in high-paranoia individuals. Analyzing participants' speech as they freely recall the narrative reveals semantic and syntactic features that also scale with paranoia. Results indicate that a personality trait can act as an intrinsic 'prime,' yielding different neural and behavioral responses to the same stimulus across individuals.",https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001338/versions/1.0.0,,journal_article,10.1038/s41467-018-04387-2,
"Highlight results, don't hide them: Enhance interpretation, reduce biases and improve reproducibility","Paul Taylor, Richard Reynolds, Vince Calhoun, Javier Gonzalez-Castillo, Daniel Handwerker, Peter Bandettini, Amanda Mejia, Gang Chen","peter_bandettini, javier_gonzalez-castillo, daniel_handwerker",2023-07-01,NeuroImage,274.0,120138,,,"Most neuroimaging studies display results that represent only a tiny fraction of the collected data. While it is conventional to present 'only the significant results' to the reader, here we suggest that this practice has several negative consequences for both reproducibility and understanding. This practice hides away most of the results of the dataset and leads to problems of selection bias and irreproducibility, both of which have been recognized as major issues in neuroimaging studies recently. Opaque, all-or-nothing thresholding, even if well-intentioned, places undue influence on arbitrary filter values, hinders clear communication of scientific results, wastes data, is antithetical to good scientific practice, and leads to conceptual inconsistencies. It is also inconsistent with the properties of the acquired data and the underlying biology being studied. Instead of presenting only a few statistically significant locations and hiding away the remaining results, studies should 'highlight' the former while also showing as much as possible of the rest. This is distinct from but complementary to utilizing data sharing repositories: the initial presentation of results has an enormous impact on the interpretation of a study. We present practical examples and extensions of this approach for voxelwise, regionwise and cross-study analyses using publicly available data that was analyzed previously by 70 teams (NARPS; Botvinik-Nezer, et al., 2020), showing that it is possible to balance the goals of displaying a full set of results with providing the reader reasonably concise and 'digestible' findings. In particular, the highlighting approach sheds useful light on the kind of variability present among the NARPS teams' results, which is primarily a varied strength of agreement rather than disagreement. Using a meta-analysis built on the informative 'highlighting' approach shows this relative agreement, while one using the standard 'hiding' approach does not. We describe how this simple but powerful change in practice - focusing on highlighting results, rather than hiding all but the strongest ones - can help address many large concerns within the field, or at least to provide more complete information about them. We include a list of practical suggestions for results reporting to improve reproducibility, cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32483374/,https://github.com/afni/apaper_highlight_narps,journal_article,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120138,education
