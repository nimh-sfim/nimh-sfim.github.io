The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has been most widely used for its easy implementation and high sensitivity. However, the BOLD signal is dependent on various anatomical, physiological, and imaging parameters, thus its interpretation with respect to physiological parameters is not straightforward. To understand the physiological source of the BOLD signal, measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes are helpful. In this chapter, we discussed (1) various fMRI techniques, (2) the sources of the BOLD fMRI signals, (3) improvement of BOLD techniques, (4) contrast-to-noise consideration, and (5) spatial and temporal resolution. CBF can be measured using arterial spin labeling MR methods, and CBV change can be detected using a vascular space occupancy-dependent technique. Conventional gradient-echo BOLD fMRI is sensitive to intravascular and extravascular signals of small and large venous vessels, while spin-echo BOLD fMRI is sensitive to intravascular signals of all-sized venous vessels and extravascular signals of small vessels. At high magnetic fields, intravascular signals can be reduced by shortening blood T2 relative to tissue T2. Thus, SE BOLD fMRI at high fields improves spatial specificity. Intrinsic spatial and temporal resolution of hemodynamic-based fMRI techniques is dependent on vascular structures and responses. Using fMRI, submillimeter functional structures can be mapped, and an order of second temporal resolution can be achieved. Overall, fMRI opened a window of basic and clinical neuroscience research.",,10.1007/978-3-031-10909-6_19,,,,education,book_chapter,kim_and_bandettini_2024.md

However, this information can be inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable in multiple scenarios such as resting-state, naturalistic paradigms or clinical conditions. In these cases, blind estimates of neuronal-related activity can be obtained with paradigm-free analysis methods such as hemodynamic deconvolution. Yet, current formulations of the hemodynamic deconvolution problem have three important limitations: 1) their efficacy strongly depends on the appropriate selection of regularization parameters, 2) being univariate, they do not take advantage of the information present across the brain, and 3) they do not provide any measure of statistical certainty associated with each detected event. Here we propose a novel approach that addresses all these limitations. Specifically, we introduce MvME-SPFM (multivariate multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping), a novel hemodynamic deconvolution algorithm that operates at the whole brain level and adds spatial information via a mixed-norm regularization term over all voxels. Additionally, MvME-SPFM employs a stability selection procedure that removes the need to select regularization parameters and also lets us obtain an estimate of the true probability of having a neuronal-related BOLD event at each voxel and time-point based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths. Besides, the formulation is tailored for multi-echo fMRI acquisitions, which allows us to better isolate fluctuations of BOLD origin on the basis of their linear dependence with Echo Time (TE) and to assign physiologically interpretable units (i.e., changes in the apparent transverse relaxation ) to the resulting deconvolved events. We demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art deconvolution approaches, and shows higher spatial and temporal agreement with the activation maps and BOLD signals obtained with a standard model-based linear regression approach, even at the level of individual neuronal events. Consequently, the proposed algorithm provides more reliable estimates of neuronal-related activity, here in terms of , for the study of the dynamics of brain activity when no information about the timings of the BOLD events is available. This algorithm will be made publicly available as part of the splora Python package.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523002700,10.1016/j.media.2023.103010,,,,,journal_article,urunuela_et_al_2024.md

Naturalistic fMRI predictors of emergent reading,2024-01-29,Neuropsychologia,193,,,,,,"Despite reading being an essential and almost universal skill in the developed world, reading proficiency varies substantially from person to person. To study why, the fMRI field is beginning to turn from single-word or nonword reading tasks to naturalistic stimuli like connected text and listening to stories. To study reading development in children just beginning to read, listening to stories is an appropriate paradigm because speech perception and phonological processing are important for, and are predictors of, reading proficiency. Our study examined the relationship between behavioral reading-related skills and the neural response to listening to stories in the fMRI environment. Functional MRI were gathered in a 3T TIM-Trio scanner. During the fMRI scan, children aged approximately 7 years listened to professionally narrated common short stories and answered comprehension questions following the narration. Analyses of the data used inter-subject correlation (ISC), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Our primary finding is that ISC reveals areas of increased synchrony in both high- and low-performing emergent readers previously implicated in reading ability/disability. Of particular interest are that several previously identified brain regions (medial temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG)) were found to “synchronize” across higher reading ability participants, while lower reading ability participants had idiosyncratic activation patterns in these regions. Additionally, two regions (superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and another portion of ITG) were recruited by all participants, but their specific timecourse of activation depended on reading performance. These analyses support the idea that different brain regions involved in reading follow different developmental trajectories that correlate with reading proficiency on a spectrum rather than the usual dichotomy of poor readers versus strong readers.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839322300297X,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108763,,,,,journal_article,wat_et_al_2024.md

Traditional theories hold that facial viewpoint is represented by view-selective mechanisms at early visual processing stages and that representations become increasingly tolerant to viewpoint changes in higher-level visual areas. Newer theories, based on single-neuron monkey electrophysiological recordings, suggest an additional intermediate processing stage invariant to mirror-symmetric face views. Consistent with traditional theories, human studies combining neuroimaging and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods have provided evidence of view-selectivity in early visual cortex. However, contradictory results have been reported in higher-level visual areas concerning the existence in humans of mirror-symmetrically tuned representations. We believe these results reflect low-level stimulus confounds and data analysis choices. To probe for low-level confounds, we analyzed images from two popular face databases. Analyses of mean image luminance and contrast revealed biases across face views described by even polynomials—i.e., mirror-symmetric. To explain major trends across human neuroimaging studies of viewpoint selectivity, we constructed a network model that incorporates three biological constraints: cortical magnification, convergent feedforward projections, and interhemispheric connections. Given the identified low-level biases, we show that a gradual increase of interhemispheric connections across network layers is sufficient to replicate findings of mirror-symmetry in high-level processing stages, as well as view-tuning in early processing stages. Data analysis decisions—pattern dissimilarity measure and data recentering—accounted for the variable observation of mirror-symmetry in late processing stages. The model provides a unifying explanation of MVPA studies of viewpoint selectivity. We also show how common analysis choices can lead to erroneous conclusions.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/17/e0296232024.abstract,https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0296-23.2024,,https://github.com/toporam/model-crossings,,,journal_article,revsine_et_al_2024.md

Our findings demonstrated that as alertness decreased, passively listening to auditory tones led to increased synchronization in the parietal lobe, whereas actively performing an auditory task resulted in increased long-range frontoparietal synchronization. During decreasing alertness, passive listening (but not active task engagement) was associated with widespread increased synchronization between the thalamus and cortex.

(2023) present novel analyses demonstrating that brain dynamics can be understood as resulting from the excitation of geometric modes, derived from the shape of the brain. Notably, they demonstrate that linear combinations of geometric modes can reconstruct patterns of fMRI data more accurately, and with fewer dimensions, than comparable connectivity-derived modes. Equipped with these results, and underpinned by neural field theory, the authors contend that the geometry of the cortical surface provides a more parsimonious explanation of brain activity than structural brain connectivity. This claim runs counter to prevailing theories of information flow in the brain, which emphasize the role of long-distance axonal projections and fasciculated white matter in relaying signals between cortical regions (Honey et al. 2009; Deco et al. 2011; Seguin et al., 2023). While we acknowledge that cortical geometry plays an important role in shaping human brain function, we feel that the presented work falls short of establishing that the brain’s geometry is “a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity” (Pang et al. 2023). Here, we provide 1) a brief critique of the paper’s framing and 2) evidence showing that their methodology lacks specificity to the brain’s orientation and shape.

To reconcile these observations, we use wide-field optical mapping to simultaneously record pan-cortical neuronal and hemodynamic activity in awake, spontaneously behaving mice. Some components of observed neuronal activity clearly represent sensory and motor function. However, particularly during quiet rest, strongly fluctuating patterns of activity across diverse brain regions contribute greatly to interregional correlations.

While it is conventional to present ""only the significant results"" to the reader, here we suggest that this practice has several negative consequences for both reproducibility and understanding. This practice hides away most of the results of the dataset and leads to problems of selection bias and irreproducibility, both of which have been recognized as major issues in neuroimaging studies recently. Opaque, all-or-nothing thresholding, even if well-intentioned, places undue influence on arbitrary filter values, hinders clear communication of scientific results, wastes data, is antithetical to good scientific practice, and leads to conceptual inconsistencies. It is also inconsistent with the properties of the acquired data and the underlying biology being studied. Instead of presenting only a few statistically significant locations and hiding away the remaining results, studies should ""highlight"" the former while also showing as much as possible of the rest. This is distinct from but complementary to utilizing data sharing repositories: the initial presentation of results has an enormous impact on the interpretation of a study. We present practical examples and extensions of this approach for voxelwise, regionwise and cross-study analyses using publicly available data that was analyzed previously by 70 teams (NARPS; Botvinik-Nezer, et al., 2020), showing that it is possible to balance the goals of displaying a full set of results with providing the reader reasonably concise and ""digestible"" findings. In particular, the highlighting approach sheds useful light on the kind of variability present among the NARPS teams’ results, which is primarily a varied strength of agreement rather than disagreement. Using a meta-analysis built on the informative ""highlighting"" approach shows this relative agreement, while one using the standard ""hiding"" approach does not. We describe how this simple but powerful change in practice—focusing on highlighting results, rather than hiding all but the strongest ones—can help address many large concerns within the field, or at least to provide more complete information about them.

This approach is very well suited to the study of reading, where narrative is central to natural experience.

In this study, we presented coherent stories to adolescents and young adults with a wide range of reading abilities. The stories were presented in alternating visual and auditory blocks. We used a dimensional inter-subject correlation analysis to identify regions in which better and worse readers had varying levels of consistency with other readers. This analysis identified a widespread set of brain regions in which activity timecourses were more similar among better readers than among worse readers. These differences were not detected with standard block activation analyses. Worse readers had higher correlation with better readers than with other worse readers, suggesting that the worse readers had “idiosyncratic” responses rather than using a single compensatory mechanism.

Yet, our ability to explore tvFC is severely constrained by its large dimensionality (several thousands). To overcome this difficulty, researchers often seek to generate low dimensional representations (e.g., 2D and 3D scatter plots) hoping those will retain important aspects of the data (e.g., relationships to behavior and disease progression). Limited prior empirical work suggests that manifold learning techniques (MLTs)—namely those seeking to infer a low dimensional non-linear surface (i.e., the manifold) where most of the data lies—are good candidates for accomplishing this task. Here we explore this possibility in detail. First, we discuss why one should expect tvFC data to lie on a low dimensional manifold. Second, we estimate what is the intrinsic dimension (ID; i.e., minimum number of latent dimensions) of tvFC data manifolds. Third, we describe the inner workings of three state-of-the-art MLTs: Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEs), T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). For each method, we empirically evaluate its ability to generate neuro-biologically meaningful representations of tvFC data, as well as their robustness against hyper-parameter selection. Our results show that tvFC data has an ID that ranges between 4 and 26, and that ID varies significantly between rest and task states. We also show how all three methods can effectively capture subject identity and task being performed: UMAP and T-SNE can capture these two levels of detail concurrently, but LE could only capture one at a time. We observed substantial variability in embedding quality across MLTs, and within-MLT as a function of hyper-parameter selection. To help alleviate this issue, we provide heuristics that can inform future studies. Finally, we also demonstrate the importance of feature normalization when combining data across subjects and the role that temporal autocorrelation plays in the application of MLTs to tvFC data.

As FMRI research trends toward studies with larger sample sizes and highly automated processing pipelines, the people who analyze data are often distinct from those who collect and preprocess the data. While there are good reasons for this trend, it also means that important information about how data were acquired, and their quality, may be missed by those working at later stages of these workflows. Similarly, an abundance of publicly available datasets, where people (not always correctly) assume others already validated data quality, makes it easier for trainees to advance in the field without learning how to identify problematic data. This manuscript is designed as an introduction for researchers who are already familiar with fMRI, but who did not get hands on QC training or who want to think more deeply about QC. This could be someone who has analyzed fMRI data but is planning to personally acquire data for the first time, or someone who regularly uses openly shared data and wants to learn how to better assess data quality. We describe why good QC processes are important, explain key priorities and steps for fMRI QC, and as part of the FMRI Open QC Project, we demonstrate some of these steps by using AFNI software and AFNI’s QC reports on an openly shared dataset. A good QC process is context dependent and should address whether data have the potential to answer a scientific question, whether any variation in the data has the potential to skew or hide key results, and whether any problems can potentially be addressed through changes in acquisition or data processing. Automated metrics are essential and can often highlight a possible problem, but human interpretation at every stage of a study is vital for understanding causes and potential solutions.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1100544/full,10.3389/fnins.2023.1100544,https://osf.io/qaesm/,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/SFIM_Frontiers_Neuroimaging_QC_Project,,education,journal_article,teves_et_al_2023.md

A widely accepted theory is that afterimages are caused by retinal signaling that continues after the physical disappearance of a light stimulus. However, afterimages have been reported without preceding visual, sensory stimulation (e.g. conditioned afterimages and afterimages induced by illusory vision). These observations suggest the role of top-down brain mechanisms in afterimage conscious perception. Therefore, some afterimages may share perceptual features with sensory-independent conscious perceptions (e.g. imagery, hallucinations, and dreams) that occur without bottom-up sensory input. In the current investigation, we tested for a link between the vividness of visual imagery and afterimage conscious perception. Participants reported their vividness of visual imagery and perceived sharpness, contrast, and duration of negative afterimages. The afterimage perceptual features were acquired using perception matching paradigms that were validated on image stimuli. Relating these perceptual reports revealed that the vividness of visual imagery positively correlated with afterimage contrast and sharpness. These behavioral results support shared neural mechanisms between visual imagery and afterimages. However, we cannot exclude alternative explanations, including demand characteristics and afterimage perception reporting inaccuracy. This study encourages future research combining neurophysiology recording methods and afterimage paradigms to directly examine the neural mechanisms of afterimage conscious perception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11294681/,10.1093/nc/niae032,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/Afterimage-Imagery-Behavioral,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/Afterimage-Imagery-Behavioral,,consciousness,journal_article,kronemer_et_al_2024a.md

(Science, 378, 160-168, 2022) reported direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA) by fMRI in anesthetized mice at 9.4 T, which could be a revolutionary approach for advancing systems neuroscience research. There have been no independent replications of this observation to date. We performed fMRI experiments in anesthetized mice at an ultrahigh field of 15.2 T using the identical protocol as in their paper. The BOLD response to whisker stimulation was reliably detected in the primary barrel cortex before and after DIANA experiments; however, no direct neuronal activity-like fMRI peak was observed in individual animals’ data with the 50–300 trials used in the DIANA publication. Extensively averaged data involving 1,050 trials in 6 mice (1,050×54 = 56,700 stimulus events) and having a temporal signal-to-noise ratio of 7,370, showed a flat baseline and no detectable neuronal activity-like fMRI peak. Thus we were unable to replicate the previously reported results using the same methods, despite a much higher number of trials, a much higher temporal signal-to-noise ratio, and a much higher magnetic field strength. We were able to demonstrate spurious, non-replicable peaks when using a small number of trials. It was only when performing the inappropriate approach of excluding outliers not conforming to the expected temporal characteristics of the response did we see a clear signal change; however, these signals were not observed when such a outlier elimination approach was not used.",https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adl0999,10.1126/sciadv.adl0999,,,,,journal_article,choi_et_al_2024.md

Recently, a family of data-driven analyses have provided such reliable measures when applied to large, population-level datasets. In the current pre-registered replication study, we show that the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods previously developed using resting-state magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity and subject measures (SMs) of cognition and behaviour from healthy adults are also effective in measuring well-being (a ‘positive–negative axis') in an independent developmental dataset. Our replication was successful in two out of three of our pre-registered criteria, such that a primary CCA mode's weights displayed a significant positive relationship and explained a significant amount of variance in both functional connectivity and SMs. The only criterion that was not successful was that compared to other modes the magnitude of variance explained by the primary CCA mode was smaller than predicted, a result that could indicate a developmental trajectory of a primary mode.

Unfortunately, wakefulness is rarely monitored due to the need for additional concurrent recordings (e.g., eye tracking, EEG). Recent work has shown that strong fluctuations around 0.05Hz, hypothesized to be CSF inflow, appear in the fourth ventricle (FV) when subjects fall asleep, and that they correlate significantly with the global signal. The analysis of these fluctuations could provide an easy way to evaluate wakefulness in fMRI-only data and improve our understanding of FC during sleep. Here we evaluate this possibility using the 7T resting-state sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results replicate the observation that fourth ventricle ultra-slow fluctuations (∼0.05Hz) with inflow-like characteristics (decreasing in intensity for successive slices) are present in scans during which subjects did not comply with instructions to keep their eyes open (i.e., drowsy scans). This is true despite the HCP data not being optimized for the detection of inflow-like effects. In addition, time-locked BOLD fluctuations of the same frequency could be detected in large portions of grey matter with a wide range of temporal delays and contribute in significant ways to our understanding of how FC changes during sleep. First, these ultra-slow fluctuations explain half of the increase in global signal that occurs during descent into sleep. Similarly, global shifts in FC between awake and sleep states are driven by changes in this slow frequency band. Second, they can influence estimates of inter-regional FC. For example, disconnection between frontal and posterior components of the Defulat Mode Network (DMN) typically reported during sleep were only detectable after regression of these ultra-slow fluctuations. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the power spectrum of these ultra-slow FV fluctuations can help us reproduce sample-level sleep patterns (e.g., a substantial number of subjects descending into sleep 3 minutes following scanning onset), partially rank scans according to overall drowsiness levels, and predict individual segments of elevated drowsiness (at 60 seconds resolution) with 71% accuracy.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922005419?via%3Dihub,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119424,,https://github.com/nimh-sfim/hcp7t_fv_sleep,,bold_connectivity_dynamics,journal_article,gonzalez_castillo_et_al_2022.md

It remains unknown, however, how the layers in the human area 3b contribute to the temporal prediction error processing. To investigate prediction error representation in the area 3b across layers, we acquired layer-specific functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data at 7T from human area 3b during a task of index finger poking with no-delay, short-delay and long-delay touching sequences. We demonstrate that all three tasks increased activity in both superficial and deep layers of area 3b compared to the random sensory input. The fMRI signal was differentially modulated solely in the deep layers rather than the superficial layers of area 3b by the delay time. Compared with the no-delay stimuli, activity was greater in the deep layers of area 3b during the short-delay stimuli but lower during the long-delay stimuli. This difference activity features in the superficial and deep layers suggest distinct functional contributions of area 3b layers to tactile temporal prediction error processing.

This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigates time-dependent haptic object processing by examining brain activity during haptic 3D curve and roughness estimations. For this experiment, we designed sixteen haptic stimuli (4 kinds of curves × 4 varieties of roughness) for the haptic curve and roughness estimation tasks. Twenty participants were asked to move their right index and middle fingers along the surface twice and to estimate one of the two features—roughness or curvature—depending on the task instruction. We found that the brain activity in several higher-level regions (e.g., the bilateral posterior parietal cortex) linearly increased as the number of curves increased during the haptic exploration phase. Surprisingly, we found that the contralateral PSC was parametrically modulated by the number of curves only during the late exploration phase but not during the early exploration phase. In contrast, we found no similar parametric modulation activity patterns during the haptic roughness estimation task in either the contralateral PSC or in higher-level regions. Thus, our findings suggest that haptic 3D object perception is processed across the cortical hierarchy, whereas the contralateral PSC interacts with other higher-level regions across time in a manner that is dependent upon the features of the object.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921000318?via%3Dihub,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117754,,,,layer_fmri,journal_article,yang_et_al_2021.md
