bio: "Esther received her B.A. in Psychology from Emory University in May 2023. As an undergraduate, she worked with Dr. Jennifer Stevens at the Grady Trauma Project, investigating neuroendocrine risk factors for PTSD in women using fMRI. After graduation, she joined the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) under Dr. Nora Volkow, where she applied PET and fMRI techniques to study dopaminergic signaling in individuals recovering from opioid use disorder. Her clinical research exposure deepened her appreciation for the role of functional imaging in understanding human disease and sparked a growing interest to explore its technical and methodological foundations. Pursuing this interest, she joined Dr. Peter Bandettiniâ€™s core (FMRIF) and section (SFIM), where she contributes to a deep sampling study focused on capturing stable and dynamic aspects of brain function. She plans to pursue an MD or MD-PhD to integrate clinical care with innovative imaging science."
