bio: "Stephanie Swegle graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May 2024 with a major in Neuroscience and Behavior and a minor in Data Science. During undergrad, she conducted gut microbiome research in the Archie Lab at Notre Dame, the Sonnenburg Lab at Stanford University and the Gibbons Lab at the Institute for Systems Biology. In these labs, she studied microbial niche space, the host range of bacteriophages, and how diet impacts the abundances of microbes that produce neurotransmitters. Stephanie joined NIH in July 2024 as a postbac IRTA. Specifically, she will work with Renzo Huber in the layer-fMRI group within Peter Bandettiniâ€™s section (SFIM) and core (FMIRF). She is excited to learn more about neuroimaging and how to use fMRI to explore the cortical layers of the brain. After her NIH fellowship, Stephanie plans to pursue a PhD in neuroscience, psychology or biology. In the future, she hopes to use neuroimaging methods to study the gut-brain connection."
