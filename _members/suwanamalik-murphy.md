bio: "Plyfaa Suwanamalik-Murphy graduated from the University of California, Davis, in the Spring of 2024, majoring in Cognitive Science. She has previously investigated the perception of iridescence, search performance within naturalistic scenes using eye-tracking, and how the C1 component reflects the initial feedforward signal in V1. Joining SFIM as a postbac IRTA in the Summer of 2024, Plyfaa aims to further build on her computational skills within research and explore neuroimaging methods. Upon completion of her fellowship at the NIH, she intends to pursue a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience."
