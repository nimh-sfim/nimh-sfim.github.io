bio: "Josh Dean graduated from Northwestern University in June 2023 with a major in biomedical engineering. At Northwestern, Josh worked with Dr. Molly Bright to investigate neural and vascular networks and sensorimotor task activation using fMRI. His last and most involved project was exploring the influence of a hypoxia intervention, which has previously shown positive health outcomes to spinal cord injury patients, on brain activation during a motor task. Josh joined SFIM in July 2023 to learn more about ultra-high-field functional MRI. After the conclusion of his fellowship, Josh plans to pursue an MD."
