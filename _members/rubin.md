As an undergraduate, she worked with Dr. Catherine Stoodley to investigate the role of the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorder. Her final project examined how cerebellar circuits contribute to functional connectivity alterations in ASD. She joined SFIM as a postbac IRTA in spring 2024 to further explore neuroimaging methods. Following her fellowship at the NIH, she plans to pursue a PhD in neuroscience."
