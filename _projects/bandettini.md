bio: "<p>Dr. Bandettini received his B.S. in Physics from Marquette University in 1989 and his Ph.D. in Biophysics from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1994, where he and his fellow graduate student, Eric Wong, played a role in the early development of magnetic resonance imaging of human brain function using blood oxygenation contrast. During his postdoctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he continued his investigation of methods to increase the interpretability, resolution, and applicability of functional MRI techniques. In March of 1999, he joined NIMH as an Investigator in the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition and as the Director of the NIH Functional MRI core facility. In 2001, he was awarded the Scientific Director's Merit Award for his efforts in establishing the NIH FMRI core facility and in 2007 the team that he created was also awarded the Scientific Director's Merit Award for their outstanding work. In 2002, he was awarded the Wiley Young Investigator's Award at the annual Organization for Human Brain Mapping Meeting.</p>

<p>Dr. Bandettini is currently Editor-In-Chief of the jounal NeuroImage. He has been deeply involved with the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) since 1997, serving as President from 2005-2007, Chair of the Program Committee from 2011-present and from 2001-2003, Secretary from 1999-2001, Chair of the Education Committee from 2000-2001. He has been a member of the OHBM scientific program committee for all years since 1997 except 1998, and 2008-11. He has also been very active in the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), serving on their program committee from 2007-2010.</p>

<p>His laboratory is currently developing MRI methods improve resolution, sensitivity, interpretability, and applicability of functional MRI. His specific scientific interests are in the areas of fMRI decoding, multiple simultaneously embedded contrast fMRI, resting state fMRI, and multi-modal imaging. He also is very much motivated to move fMRI from a niche technique for understanding brian function in mostly healthy individuals and groups to a robust and informative technique that is used in the clinic on individuals to help diagnose disease and help predict treatment outcome. He strongly feels fMRI has considerable untapped potential for revealing a wealth of neuronal and physioligic information from individuals.</p>
