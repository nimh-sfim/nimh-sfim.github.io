<h2>1. Patch Analysis</h2>
<p>Cerebral blood volume (CBV) weighted fMRI with sub millimeter resolution has been shown to resolve layer specific brain activity. Most of the layer studies are focused on reporting depth dependent activity patterns so called layer profiles. However, those profiles are very dynamic in time and averaging them across time may mislead the interpretation of feedback and feedforward activity patterns. Here we propose a patch analysis, which focuses both depth and time information of a given cortical patch. This not only helps direct viewing of profile changes in time, but it also allows several different analysis approaches like ranking feedback and feed forwardness, capturing time instances of a specific layer in time in each cortical patch.</p>

<h2>2. Layer Regional Homogeneity (ReHo)</h2>
<p>Cerebral blood volume (CBV) weighted fMRI with sub millimeter resolution has been shown to resolve layer specific brain activity. However rigorous processing pipelines are needed to localize the depth dependent activity. Here we propose a simple tool to characterize mesoscale structure by using local connectivity patterns. It is model free and fast tool for exploring any layer data given only the depth of the voxels, also the regions Layer ReHo highlights are in line with the task dependent activity.</p>
