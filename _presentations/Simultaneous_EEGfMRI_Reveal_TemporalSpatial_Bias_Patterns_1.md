summary: "<p>The use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI in neurobiological research yields information on both the temporal and spatial indices of cognition (Snyder & Raichle, 2010). In this project, we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of hate, which remain relatively unexplored (Zeki & Romaya, 2008). Life history interviews were conducted on a sample of 100 former US white supremacists in order to investigate disengagement from political extremism and social reintegration efforts. Self-report data suggest that substantial unwanted and involuntary beliefs, feelings, and behavior continue to characterize the individualsâ€™ experiences following disengagement (Simi et al 2017). The unique nature of the sample is underscored by the absence of previous imaging studies of either current or former political extremists. We hypothesized that former white supremacist would exhibit distinct neural activation patterns compared to the control group of non-extremists when viewing symbols and images with racially and politically charged characteristics.</p>"
