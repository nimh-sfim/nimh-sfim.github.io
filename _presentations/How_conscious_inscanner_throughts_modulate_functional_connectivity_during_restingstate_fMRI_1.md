summary: "<p>Previous research has suggested that ongoing in-scanner experience may modulate patterns of functional connectivity during resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI)1,2,3,4. However, the extent to which these experiences contribute to individual variability in rsfMRI functional connectivity (FC) remains unknown. Understanding these phenomena is key to explaining unknown variability in healthy subjects and clinical populations (i.e., biomarkers). To address this knowledge gap, we aim to analyze the relationship between FC and reported in-scanner experiences during resting-state fMRI scans. First, we look for significant differences in FC between scans grouped based on different reported patterns of thought. Then, we demonstrate it is possible to predict reported patterns of thought using FC data.</p>"
