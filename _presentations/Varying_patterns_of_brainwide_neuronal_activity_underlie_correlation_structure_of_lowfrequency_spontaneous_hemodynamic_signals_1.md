summary: "<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have extensively investigated the correlation structure of 'baseline' hemodynamic fluctuations. These studies have revealed resting-state neural networks whose dynamic changes may be related to shifts in brain states during rest. The findings, however, have been inconsistent and difficult to interpret. The primary reason for this is the lack of a thorough understanding of the neural basis that underlies hemodynamic correlations.</p>

<p>Goal of Study</p>

<p>Here, wide-field optical mapping (WFOM) provided us with a unique opportunity to simultaneously record neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in awake, spontaneously behaving mice. We aimed to characterize dynamic changes in cortex-wide neuronal correlation patterns and their relationship to mouse behavior and brain hemodynamics.</p>"
