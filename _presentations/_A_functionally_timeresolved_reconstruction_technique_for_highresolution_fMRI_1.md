summary: "<p>● Sub-millimeter fMRI is a promising method to probe mesoscopic brain responses yet is currently too coarse to sample from individual human columns and layers.</p>

<p>● High-resolution fMRI using EPI readouts and BOLD contrast suffer from spatial distortions and T2* blurring due to long readout trains.</p>

<p>● Here, we build on time resolved methods to incorporate neuroscientific experimental designs into fMRI reconstruction to time-resolved data from a multi-echo, multi-shot gradient echo sequence.</p>

<p>● Our method, <strong>functionally time-resolved fMRI </strong>(fTR), can achieve very high spatial resolution (here, 0.5 mm) with multiple (6) echoes without sacrificing temporal resolution (here, 0.5 s).</p>"
