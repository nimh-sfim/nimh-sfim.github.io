summary: "<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Auditory and visual information interact in the brain.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Audiovisual Bounce Effect (ABE) [1,2,3] is an illusion in which auditory  stimulation affects visual perception.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Two circles move towards each other on a computer screen and meet in the middle. If a sound is played when the circles meet, the viewer is more likely to perceive them as bouncing, as opposed to streaming past each other.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>We lack a full description of the perceptual and neuronal factors modulating the ABE.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We performed a behavioral experiment to better understand stimulus factors that modulate the ABE, as well as the impact of previous trial outcomes on perception.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We conducted an fMRI study to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Localize multisensory integration involved in ABE [5,6] , specifically to guide future high resolution studies.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Understand individual differences in behavioral factors and neural correlates modulating the ABE.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
