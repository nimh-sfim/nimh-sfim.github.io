summary: "<p>Movie watching can engage multiple cortical networks simultaneously</p>

<p>Multi-session open source laminar dataset2 is used with the recent sequence improvements for whole brain layer resolution (~ 0.8mm iso)</p>

<p>The first subject of the datasets discussed to be too artifact- dominated3 especially in the mid-brain regions, with the sequence improvement in the second version (second subject) may open possibility of analyzing subcortical time courses with reduced artifacts.</p>

<p>Here we investigate and discuss subcortical contribution to whole cortex and their<br />
relation separately to each task related cortical network.</p>
